      <h2>Introduction</h2> 
      The <em>3333-Game Club</em> is in &beta;
      stage.  Note the date-stamped version on the title.  The server
      and the software may be upgraded at anytime without warning.
      Sorry, but such upgrades may occur even while you're playing,
      thus destroying your game table.

      <h2>Club</h2>
      The club has a limited number of active tables.
      Their names are shown when you enter the club.
      Each name is followed by the number of players (in parenthesis).
      You may <em>create</em> a new table or <em>join</em> an existing table.

      <h2>Table</h2>
      
      A table is a place where players can play a game.
      Two passcodes are involved.
      <ul>
	<li> A passcode for the table. This passcode controls who may join.
	</li>
	<li> A passcode for the player. This is used when a player wants
	  to re-join a table after being disconnected.
	</li>
      </ul>
      Each of these passcodes may be empty, thus giving simple access.
      <br>
      <b>Note:</b> The passcodes are not secured and are not encrypted.
      They are merely ad-hoc table secrets.
      Their life duration is that of the table.

      <h3>Create a New Table</h3>
      When creating a new table, you become the <em>owner</em> of the table
      and your player name becomes also the name of the table.
      Pick a passcode for the table, and let your friends who wish to join
      have it.
      You may pick a passcode for yourself as a player (see above).

      <h3>Join a Table</h3>
      When joining a table, you need to provide the passcode
      that the owner picked for the table.
      If the owner chose to have no passcode for he table, 
      this passcode will be ignored and you may simply join.
      <br>
      You may pick a passcode for yourself as a player (see above).


      <h2>Playing</h2>

      <p>
      The goal of the game is to find 3-cards sets, such that 
      for each of the following 4 categories
      <ul>
	<li>Number of element(s)</li>
	<li>Color of element(s)</li>
	<li>Shape of element(s)</li>
	<li>Shading of element(s)</li>
      </ul>
      they all are the same, or they all differ.
      </p>

      <p>
      Only the owner (table's first player) may start a new game.
      The game starts with 12 random cards dealt to the table
      from a deck originally containing 81=3&middot;3&middot;3&middot;3 cards.
      You may click on the card to (de)select them.
      Once 3 cards are selected they will be tested for being a "set"
      for which the above rule holds.
      </p>

      <p>
      When there are no sets available, you may ask to add 3 more cards 
      to the table. When there are no more cards left in the deck
      and no more sets are to be found, click on <em>No More</em> button.
      If you are right, the game ends.
      If you are the owner then a new game will start.
      Otherwise, you will need to wait for the owner to start a new game.
      </p>

      <h2>Score</h2>
      A displayed table keeps a score for each player
      for the following numbers of
      <ul>
	<li>sets found</li>
	<li>bad calls</li>
	<li>right claims that displayed cards have no set</li>
	<li>wrong claims for no set</li>
      </ul>
      The last column of the table, allows for a 1-line chat.
